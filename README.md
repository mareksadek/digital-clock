# Abstract
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a digital watch with stopwatch and alarm functionalities using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) and an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) development board. The primary objective was to create a fully functional, real-time digital clock system that can display time, set an alarm, and operate a stopwatch.

# Hardware description of demo application
FUnctionality of this project was tested on a fpga board Nexys-a7-50T. The board itself includes many various ports, buttons, 8 seven segment displays and many more which wasn't really much of our concern since the majority of our code was tested on 7 segment display. 

# Software description
Put flowchats/state diagrams of your algorithm(s) and direct links to source/testbench files in src and sim folders.

# Component(s) simulations
Write descriptive text and put simulation screenshots of components you created during the project.
