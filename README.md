# Abstract
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a digital watch with stopwatch and alarm functionalities using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) and an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) development board. The primary objective was to create a fully functional, real-time digital clock system that can display time, set an alarm, and operate a stopwatch.
